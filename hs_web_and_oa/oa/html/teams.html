        <h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS (PURCHASE)</h2>
        <div class="left">
            <p>1.&nbsp;Level 01 Technologies Limited (the “Developer”) is a private limited company incorporated in Hong Kong
                with company number [CRN:2589454]. The Developer is conducting a Token Sale for the pre-purchase of its LVX
                token, of which the Purchaser is interested to acquire via their current online account at https://acc.level01.io.
            </p>
            <p>2.&nbsp;Level 01 account: The Purchaser has access to a personal online account that can be accessed from https://acc.level01.io.
                The Purchaser can view all details pertaining to their LVX transactions from within this online account</p>
            <p>3.&nbsp;The Developer will create a fixed amount of 1.2 Billion LVX tokens on the Ethereum blockchain to be acquired
                or exchanged with other cryptocurrency during the Token Sale periods. Most up to date information on timeframe
                and dates are to be found on http://level01.io.</p>
            <p>4.&nbsp;LVX tokens are designed to be used in the Level 01 App or website, and in connection with the platform services
                and features. Thus LVX are ‘digital goods’ in nature and are not intended to have any applicable use outside
                the scope of the application or the Developer’s future products and services. LVX are not securities and
                do not carry with them any rights as may be commonly associated with securities.</p>
            <p>5.&nbsp;Due to the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain tokens, the Developer will register and list LVX
                tokens on licensed cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure the general public will have access to LVX and hence
                the products & services of the Level 01 platform.</p>
            <p>6.&nbsp;The Developer has no control over the date of LVX being available on cryptocurrency exchanges, nor does it have
                control or influence over the designated price of the token as will be determined by market conditions. The
                Developer will use its best endeavour to ensure LVX is available on cryptocurrency exchanges after the Token
                Sale event is concluded.</p>
            <p>7.&nbsp;The Purchaser verified in this online account at https://acc.level01.io has expressed interest in acquiring or
                exchanging with other cryptocurrencies for an indicated amount of LVX tokens. The Purchaser is not a consumer
                in the relevant sense of consumer protection laws or regulations.</p>
